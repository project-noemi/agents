# Pending Clarifications

This file now tracks only active, unresolved questions that still require product-owner input or an external artifact.

## Current Status

- There are no open product clarifications blocking the repository at this time.
- [2026-04-03] Resolved ROI Google Sheets Template URL (URL confirmed in `tools/roi/README.md`) and `logging-mcp` configuration scope (remains reference-only, not added to `mcp.config.json`).
- Durable answers from the March-April 2026 clarification backlog were normalized into [DECISION_LOG.md](DECISION_LOG.md), especially the entries dated `2026-04-02`.
- Questions that were superseded by implemented repo changes were closed as overtaken by events and removed from the active backlog.
- [2026-04-04] Resolved Node.js Resilience Helper scope (mandate satisfied by reference pattern; core scripts do not need retry for local filesystem ops) and Legacy Example Labeling (bulk update completed — LEGACY/ILLUSTRATIVE headers added to all Python and Bash examples).
- [2026-05-28] Bulk closure: a large block of late-cycle clarifications was either resolved by Decision entries dated 2026-05-28-0001 through 2026-05-28-0006 (logging-mcp payload alignment, onboarding directory bootstrap, SecretOps reference standardization, case-insensitive heading audits, Value Lens/Operating Profile injection, and the bulk closure of clarifications overtaken by prior decisions), or recognized as restatements of already-resolved questions. See `DECISION_LOG.md` for the durable record.
- [2026-06-12] Bulk closure: the remaining April-May 2026 clarifications were resolved by Decision entries dated 2026-06-12-0001 through 2026-06-12-0009. The open backlog is empty.
- [2026-06-26] Three new clarifications ported from PR #236 (main) — Executive Assistant "Learning Agent" Resolution Path, Rules & Constraints Heading Inconsistency, and Phase 0 Assessment Kit Audit Coverage — were resolved by Decision entries [2026-06-26-0001], [2026-06-26-0002], and [2026-06-26-0003] respectively. The ESM/CommonJS mismatch (Q [2026-06-19] Resilience Helper Module System Mismatch) was resolved by Decision [2026-06-26-0004]. The open backlog remains empty.
