# Pending Clarifications

This file now tracks only active, unresolved questions that still require product-owner input or an external artifact.

## Current Status

- There are no open product clarifications blocking the repository at this time.
- [2026-04-03] Resolved ROI Google Sheets Template URL (URL confirmed in `tools/roi/README.md`) and `logging-mcp` configuration scope (remains reference-only, not added to `mcp.config.json`).
- Durable answers from the March-April 2026 clarification backlog were normalized into [DECISION_LOG.md](DECISION_LOG.md), especially the entries dated `2026-04-02`.
- Questions that were superseded by implemented repo changes were closed as overtaken by events and removed from the active backlog.
- [2026-04-04] Resolved Node.js Resilience Helper scope (mandate satisfied by reference pattern; core scripts do not need retry for local filesystem ops) and Legacy Example Labeling (bulk update completed — LEGACY/ILLUSTRATIVE headers added to all Python and Bash examples).

### ❓ Question [YYYY-MM-DD] - Short Title
**Context:** Why this question exists and what file, workflow, or contract it relates to.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** What is unclear, contradictory, or externally blocked.
**Question for Product Owner:** The specific decision that still needs to be made.
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Optional implementation prompt once the answer is known.*
```

### ❓ Question [2026-04-03] - `logging-mcp` Activation Drift
**Context:** The `ROI Auditor` agent specification defines `logging-mcp` as a mandatory dependency for fleet-wide log ingestion, but the protocol is currently disabled (not present in `mcp.config.json`).
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The `ROI Auditor` cannot be fully validated as "active" in the current context files.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should `logging-mcp` be added to the default `active_mcps` list immediately to support Guardian agent development?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Update `mcp.config.json` to include "logging-mcp" in the `active_mcps` list and regenerate context.*

### ❓ Question [2026-04-04] - `logging-mcp` Standardized Log Shape vs. Audit Log
**Context:** `mcp-protocols/logging-mcp.md` defines a "Standardized Log Shape" that includes `timestamp`, `agent`, `task`, `status`, `duration_ms`, and `metadata`. Meanwhile, `AGENTS.md` and `REQUIREMENTS.md` mandate a "lightweight JSON summary shape" for the `Audit Log` as `{ "task": "...", "inputs": [], "actions": [], "risks": [], "result": "..." }`.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** While complementary, it's unclear if the `Audit Log` is intended to be *part* of the `logging-mcp` payload (e.g., inside `metadata`) or if they are two separate emissions that need to be reconciled.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should the `logging-mcp` protocol be updated to explicitly incorporate the mandated `Audit Log` JSON shape as the primary payload for "success" events?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Align the `logging-mcp` protocol definition with the mandatory `Audit Log` JSON shape to ensure technical consistency across the observability stack.*

### ❓ Question [2026-04-05] - `logging-mcp` InfluxDB Backend Support
**Context:** `mcp-protocols/logging-mcp.md` defines Loki/Grafana and n8n webhooks as the primary backends, but the reference implementation in `examples/gatekeeper-deployment/dashboard-ingest.js` and `docker-compose.yml` uses InfluxDB as the primary time-series datastore.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The protocol definition does not account for the primary storage mechanism used in the specialist deployment examples.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should the `logging-mcp` protocol be updated to explicitly support InfluxDB as a third canonical backend for structured log ingestion?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Update `mcp-protocols/logging-mcp.md` to include InfluxDB as a supported backend and define the corresponding query/ingestion patterns.*
