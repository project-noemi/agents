# Pre-Flight Check — Verification Skill

## Purpose
Validate that preconditions are met before executing a state-changing action. This skill standardizes the safety-first pattern used by infrastructure, engineering, and operations agents: gather context with read-only operations, assess risk, and confirm readiness before proceeding.

## Inputs
- **action** — Description of the planned state-changing action
- **target** — The system, file, service, or resource that will be affected
- **checks** — List of verification steps to perform (provided by the calling agent)
- **require_confirmation** — Whether human confirmation is required before proceeding (default: `true` for destructive actions)

## Procedure
1. **Snapshot current state** — Capture the current state of the target using read-only operations (e.g., `systemctl status`, `git status`, `df -h`, API GET calls).
2. **Run checks** — Execute each verification step in the checks list. Record pass/fail for each.
3. **Assess risk** — Categorize the action as `low-risk` (all checks pass, action is reversible), `medium-risk` (all checks pass but action is hard to reverse), or `high-risk` (one or more checks failed).
4. **Backup if applicable** — For file modifications, create a backup (e.g., `cp file file.bak`). For infrastructure changes, document the rollback procedure.
5. **Report readiness** — Return the check results and risk assessment. If `require_confirmation` is true and risk is medium or high, halt and present the plan for human approval.

## Outputs
- **status** — `READY` (all checks pass, proceed), `CONFIRM` (checks pass but human approval needed), or `ABORT` (one or more critical checks failed)
- **checks_result** — List of checks with pass/fail status
- **risk_level** — `low`, `medium`, or `high`
- **backup_path** — Path to backup if one was created
- **rollback_plan** — Description of how to reverse the action

```json
{
  "status": "CONFIRM",
  "risk_level": "medium",
  "checks_result": [
    { "check": "Service is running", "result": "pass" },
    { "check": "Config syntax valid", "result": "pass" },
    { "check": "Disk space > 1GB", "result": "pass" }
  ],
  "backup_path": "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak",
  "rollback_plan": "Restore from backup: cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak /etc/nginx/nginx.conf && systemctl reload nginx"
}
```


## Rules & Constraints (4D Diligence)
1. **Atomic Logic:** This skill must perform exactly one logical task.
2. **Standard Output:** Always return data in the mandated structured format.
3. **Safety Gating:** Adhere to all defined Boundaries and never exceed authorized tool usage.
## Boundaries
- **Always:** Perform read-only operations only during checks. Create backups before file modifications. Document the rollback plan.
- **Ask First:** Proceeding when any check fails. Skipping the backup step.
- **Never:** Execute the state-changing action during the pre-flight check. Modify the target system during verification.

## Examples

**Linux config change (SysAdmin agent):**
- Action: "Edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf to add new server block"
- Checks: [`nginx -t` (syntax), `df -h` (disk), `systemctl status nginx` (running)]
- Output: `{ "status": "CONFIRM", "risk_level": "medium", "backup_path": "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak" }`

**PR merge (Gatekeeper agent):**
- Action: "Squash-merge PR #42"
- Checks: [CI green, no conflicts, branch protection rules met]
- Output: `{ "status": "READY", "risk_level": "low", "checks_result": [...] }`
