# Pending Clarifications

This file now tracks only active, unresolved questions that still require product-owner input or an external artifact.

## Current Status

- There are no open product clarifications blocking the repository at this time.
- [2026-04-03] Resolved ROI Google Sheets Template URL (URL confirmed in `tools/roi/README.md`) and `logging-mcp` configuration scope (remains reference-only, not added to `mcp.config.json`).
- Durable answers from the March-April 2026 clarification backlog were normalized into [DECISION_LOG.md](DECISION_LOG.md), especially the entries dated `2026-04-02`.
- Questions that were superseded by implemented repo changes were closed as overtaken by events and removed from the active backlog.
- [2026-04-04] Resolved Node.js Resilience Helper scope (mandate satisfied by reference pattern; core scripts do not need retry for local filesystem ops) and Legacy Example Labeling (bulk update completed — LEGACY/ILLUSTRATIVE headers added to all Python and Bash examples).
- [2026-05-28] Bulk closure: a large block of late-cycle clarifications was either resolved by Decision entries dated 2026-05-28-0001 through 2026-05-28-0006 (logging-mcp payload alignment, onboarding directory bootstrap, SecretOps reference standardization, case-insensitive heading audits, Value Lens/Operating Profile injection, and the bulk closure of clarifications overtaken by prior decisions), or recognized as restatements of already-resolved questions. See `DECISION_LOG.md` for the durable record.
- [2026-06-25] Bulk closure: technical-implementation clarifications that were derivable from existing decisions, requirements, or industry practice were resolved by Decision entries dated 2026-06-25-0001 through 2026-06-25-0014 (multi-provider SecretOps, audit_logger.js implementation, AI model baseline updates, sync script parameterization, FORCE_DOCKER_SMOKE flag, NOEMI_DOCKER_SMOKE_* validation, audit-repo.js expansion across TBD/schema/MCP/naming/resilience/model checks, generator consolidation, journal section policy, resilience helper module system, branch protection audit method, persona/skill substantive remediation strategy, red-team-gauntlet serialization, and audit-log stderr standardization). See `DECISION_LOG.md` for the durable record.

## Template for New Questions

Add new questions below this line using the required format.

```md
### ❓ Question [YYYY-MM-DD] - Short Title
**Context:** Why this question exists and what file, workflow, or contract it relates to.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** What is unclear, contradictory, or externally blocked.
**Question for Product Owner:** The specific decision that still needs to be made.
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Optional implementation prompt once the answer is known.*
```

### ❓ Question [2026-04-03] - ROI Auditor Baseline Data Access
**Context:** The `ROI Auditor` persona is tasked with correlating actions against a "Human Baseline Time" and "Labor Rate" dictionary. `tools/roi/README.md` indicates these live in a Google Sheets template, but the `google-sheets` MCP is typically used for appending execution logs.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** There is no documented mechanism for the `ROI Auditor` to programmatically retrieve these "dictionaries" (e.g., via a specific MCP tool, a mounted JSON file, or a read-only Google Sheets range).
**Question for Product Owner:** How should the `ROI Auditor` access the baseline and labor rate data? Should we define a `google-sheets-read` capability or provide a local JSON reference file?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Add a `baseline-config.json` to `tools/roi/` or update the `ROI Auditor` persona to include a specific `read_rows` capability for the Google Sheets MCP.*

### ❓ Question [2026-04-05] - Fleet Dashboard Retention Policy Drift
**Context:** `agents/operations/fleet-dashboard.md` specifies "Retain detailed reports for 90 days, aggregate summaries for 1 year."
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The reference implementation in `examples/gatekeeper-deployment/docker-compose.yml` configures a single InfluxDB bucket with a 90-day retention policy (`DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_RETENTION=90d`) and no mechanism for long-term aggregate storage.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should the reference implementation be updated to include a second InfluxDB bucket (e.g., `agent_summaries`) with a 1-year retention policy and a downsampling task, or should the persona be updated to reflect a single 90-day retention period?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Update `examples/gatekeeper-deployment/docker-compose.yml` to provision an `agent_summaries` bucket and implement an InfluxDB task for report downsampling.*

### ❓ Question [2026-04-05] - Fleet Dashboard Multi-tenancy Implementation Gap
**Context:** The `Fleet Dashboard` persona (`agents/operations/fleet-dashboard.md`) specifies a multi-tenant registry system with per-agent HMAC secrets and asynchronous verification of mutating claims (merges, closes).
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The current reference implementation in `examples/gatekeeper-deployment/dashboard-ingest.js` is a single-agent sink with hardcoded validation logic and no registry or verification workflow.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should the `Fleet Dashboard` reference implementation be expanded to include the registry and asynchronous verification logic, or should the persona be simplified to reflect the current single-tenant implementation?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Implement the multi-tenant agent registry and asynchronous GitHub verification worker in the Fleet Dashboard reference stack.*

### ❓ Question [2026-04-23] - Gatekeeper Reference Implementation Mutating Actions
**Context:** The `Gatekeeper` agent persona describes mutating actions (merging PRs, closing issues), but the reference implementation in `examples/gatekeeper-deployment/` is currently limited to signed reporting.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The implementation truth drifts from the persona specification, leaving the "Accelerator" role partially unimplemented in the reference stack.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should we extend the Gatekeeper reference implementation to include "dry-run" or optional mutating actions to better reflect the persona's mission?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Extend the Gatekeeper deployment example and `entrypoint.sh` to include a placeholder or dry-run mode for the mutating actions defined in the Gatekeeper persona.*

### ❓ Question [2026-05-22] - Casdoor Identity Integration Logic
**Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `DECISION_LOG.md` identify Casdoor as the reference identity layer for multi-tenant deployments.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** While Casdoor is present in `fleet-deployment` compose files, there is no implementation logic in the repository (scripts, middleware, or agents) that actually performs token validation or user context extraction.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should Jules implement a reference `casdoor-auth` skill or Node.js middleware to demonstrate how agents should validate identity in a multi-tenant fleet?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Create a `skills/security/casdoor-validate.md` specification and implement basic JWT validation middleware in `examples/gatekeeper-deployment/dashboard-ingest.js`.*

### ❓ Question [2026-06-15] - Service Tier Template Specifications
**Context:** The requirements state the Client Onboarding agent references service tier templates in `templates/tiers/`, but the codebase in that directory implements only a placeholder README.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** Without these templates, the onboarding workflow cannot be demonstrated or executed, leaving the "Explorer" path blocked.
**Question for Product Owner:** Can you provide the specific service definitions (features, limits, pricing) for the Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers so I can implement the missing templates?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Implement the `basic.md`, `standard.md`, and `premium.md` templates in `templates/tiers/` using the provided service definitions.*
