### ❓ Question [2026-03-08] - Missing Kubernetes Manifests for Fleet Deployment
**Context:** The `REQUIREMENTS.md` (Strategic Alignment, Item 4) specifies that for parallel "Fleet" deployments, the repository's examples must be expanded to include "automated provisioning templates (e.g., docker-compose or Kubernetes manifests)". Currently, only a Docker Compose example is provided.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The Kubernetes requirement is documented but no manifests exist in the repository, making it difficult for users to deploy to Kubernetes-based clusters.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should Kubernetes manifests be created to complement the Docker Compose example, or is Docker Compose currently the primary target for fleet deployments?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Create a `examples/fleet-deployment/k8s/` directory and implement basic Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, and Ingress) mirroring the multi-tenant architecture found in the Docker Compose example.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-08] - Status of Verification Bots for ROI
**Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` (Strategic Alignment, Item 5) states that the toolkit must include "Verification Bots" to audit agent logs for academic credentialing and ROI validation.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** While the ROI methodology is now documented in `tools/roi/README.md`, the actual "Verification Bots" (automated agents or scripts that perform the auditing) are not yet present.
**Question for Product Owner:** Are the "Verification Bots" intended to be implemented as a new agent persona (e.g., a `guardian/roi-auditor.md`), or should they be implemented as a specialized script in the `tools/` directory?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Create a new agent persona `agents/guardian/roi-auditor.md` specifically tasked with auditing logs for ROI validation, and provide an accompanying Node.js script in `tools/roi/audit-logs.js` to automate the verification.*
