### ❓ Question [2026-03-08] - Missing Kubernetes Manifests for Fleet Deployment
**Context:** The `REQUIREMENTS.md` (Strategic Alignment, Item 4) specifies that for parallel "Fleet" deployments, the repository's examples must be expanded to include "automated provisioning templates (e.g., docker-compose or Kubernetes manifests)". Currently, only a Docker Compose example is provided.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The Kubernetes requirement is documented but no manifests exist in the repository, making it difficult for users to deploy to Kubernetes-based clusters.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should Kubernetes manifests be created to complement the Docker Compose example, or is Docker Compose currently the primary target for fleet deployments?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Create a `examples/fleet-deployment/k8s/` directory and implement basic Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, and Ingress) mirroring the multi-tenant architecture found in the Docker Compose example.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-08] - Status of Verification Bots for ROI
**Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` (Strategic Alignment, Item 5) states that the toolkit must include "Verification Bots" to audit agent logs for academic credentialing and ROI validation.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** While the ROI methodology is now documented in `tools/roi/README.md`, the actual "Verification Bots" (automated agents or scripts that perform the auditing) are not yet present.
**Question for Product Owner:** Are the "Verification Bots" intended to be implemented as a new agent persona (e.g., a `guardian/roi-auditor.md`), or should they be implemented as a specialized script in the `tools/` directory?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Create a new agent persona `agents/guardian/roi-auditor.md` specifically tasked with auditing logs for ROI validation, and provide an accompanying Node.js script in `tools/roi/audit-logs.js` to automate the verification.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-08] - JSON Schema for Mandatory "Audit Log"
**Context:** `docs/frameworks/gartner-trism.md` suggests an "Audit Log" requirement for all agent personas, instructing them to output a brief JSON summary of their reasoning alongside their final payload.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** This requirement is not currently implemented in any of the agent persona files in `agents/`. To ensure consistency, a standardized JSON schema is needed.
**Question for Product Owner:** Is there a preferred JSON schema for the "Audit Log" output? For example, should it include fields like `reasoning`, `mcp_tools_used`, and `confidence_score`?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Draft a standard JSON schema for the "Audit Log" requirement and update all agent persona files in `agents/` to include this mandatory directive.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-08] - Priority for Python-to-Node Migration in Examples
**Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `AGENTS.md` state that Python runtime support is deprecated, yet several examples (e.g., `examples/docker/agent.py`, `examples/video-automation-pod/seo_agent.py`) still utilize Python.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** There is a discrepancy between the project's official stance on Python deprecation and the live example code.
**Question for Product Owner:** What is the priority for migrating the remaining Python examples to Node.js? Should this be handled as a bulk migration or incrementally as these examples are updated?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Identify all remaining `.py` files in the repository and create a prioritized migration roadmap to convert them into Node.js equivalents.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-09] - Enforcement of Persona Documentation Mirroring
**Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` (Core Objectives, Item 2) states that "Documentation strictly mirrors these directories in `docs/agents/`." and `DECISION_LOG.md` (2026-03-03) mentions "Mandated that `docs/agents/` must strictly mirror the `agents/` hierarchy."
**Ambiguity / Drift:** While the directory structure is mirrored, individual persona Markdown files (e.g., `agents/coding/bolt/core.md`) are missing their counterparts in `docs/agents/`. Only READMEs and a few select guides exist.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should every individual persona file in `agents/` be mirrored as a documentation file in `docs/agents/`, or is mirroring only required at the directory/README level?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Identify all missing persona documentation files in `docs/agents/` and create mirror Markdown files that provide a technical overview and usage guide for each corresponding persona in `agents/`.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-10] - SecretOps CLI Verification in Pre-Flight
**Context:** `AGENTS.md` mandates the use of `infisical run` or `op run` for "Fetch-on-Demand" security. However, `scripts/verify-env.sh` and `verify-env.ps1` do not check if these CLIs are installed.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The core security policy is not enforced or verified by the project's own environment validation tools.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should the pre-flight scripts be updated to mandate the presence of either `infisical` or `op` CLIs, or should these be treated as optional dependencies?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Update `scripts/verify-env.sh` and `scripts/verify-env.ps1` to include a check for SecretOps CLIs, ensuring at least one of the mandated tools (`infisical` or `op`) is available in the environment.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-10] - Documentation for Gemini CLI Dependency
**Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `scripts/verify-env.sh` list the `gemini` CLI as a mandatory dependency for the project.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** There is no documentation within the repository explaining where to obtain this CLI, how to install it, or which version is required.
**Question for Product Owner:** Where is the official source for the `gemini` CLI, and can a "Dependencies" or "Getting Started" guide be added to `docs/` to provide installation instructions?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Create `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` to document all external toolchain requirements, specifically providing installation sources and versioning for the `gemini` CLI.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-10] - Standardized Output for Mandatory "Audit Log"
**Context:** `docs/frameworks/gartner-trism.md` and `REQUIREMENTS.md` mandate a JSON "Audit Log" for agent reasoning.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** It is unclear if this JSON payload should be emitted to `stdout`, a dedicated `.log` file, or as a specific field in the agent's final API/Markdown response.
**Question for Product Owner:** What is the standardized destination for the JSON Audit Log? Should it be printed to `stdout` following the primary output, or integrated into the final Markdown response within a `<details>` block?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Draft a technical specification for Audit Log delivery and update the `docs/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` to include a standardized "Audit Log" section that adheres to this protocol.*

### ❓ Question [2026-03-12] - Missing "External Tooling Dependencies" Section
**Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` mandates that "Agents must also document any expected external tooling dependencies (e.g., pnpm, docker) in their persona files."
**Ambiguity / Drift:** A codebase audit revealed that none of the 18 existing agent personas in the `agents/` directory currently contain this section.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should Jules proceed with adding a placeholder `## External Tooling Dependencies` section to all personas, or should this be added only as each persona is updated with specific tool requirements?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Audit all 18 persona files in `agents/` and insert a mandatory `## External Tooling Dependencies` section with initial values based on their known capabilities (e.g., Docker for infrastructure agents).*
